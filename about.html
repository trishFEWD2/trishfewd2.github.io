        <li class="flex-item">
          <h3><i class="fa-brands fa-sketch"></i> Logos</h3>
          <p>
            The brand identity for a company must be established before building a website. I create a logo  and establish an identity system and graphic standards.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li class="flex-item">
          <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-print"></i> Print</h3>
          <p>
            I began as a print graphic designer.  Solid design principles are the foundation of all my projects. Font pairings, hierarchy, color palettes, use of white space, designing for accessibility, attention to details&hellip; part of every design project. 
          </p>
        </li> 

        <li class="flex-item">
          <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-keyboard"></i> Web Design</h3>
          <p>
            Your website is critical to your success. My workflow includes designing the site's architecture after we decide on content and presenting a mockup of the site. After approval, I begin constructing the website. 
          </p>
        </li> 

        <li class="flex-item">
          <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-video"></i> Animation and Video</h3>
          <p>
            I have completed Adobe Premiere, Audition, and After Effect coursework in Motion Graphics. I have created videos using 2D animation and developed short films. I have photo and video shoot experience.
          </p>
        </li> 

        <li class="flex-item">
          <h3><i class="fas fa-sign-hanging"></i> Environmental Graphics</h3>
          <p>
           My experience in environmental graphics includes large hospitals and office campuses. Design for disabilities is essential to a good 'wayfinding' experience for everyone.  
          </p>
        </li> 

        <li class="flex-item">
          <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i> Ebooks</h3>
          <p>
            Print on demand has become a common way for self publishing. I have worked on limited edition 'coffee table' publications to promote environmental projects and set up files for POD (print-on-demand).
